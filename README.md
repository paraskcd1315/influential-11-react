That's because I haven't included all the CSS related to Fluent-System-Icons which can be found here - https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons

Also, the emulation js script to emulate Xen HTML through PC is not included. It can be found here - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matchstic/libwidgetinfo/master/emulation/emulation.js

Also, tons of assets haven't been added, you're required to get them all yourself. These include,
- Weather Icons
- iPhone Model Icons
- Explorer Icons
- XenEmulationStuff
